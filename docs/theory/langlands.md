# The Langlands Perspective
{: .no_toc }

*This page is for readers with a background in number theory, algebraic geometry,
or representation theory. It explains how the Langlands programme fits into the
TRS/ASA framework — and what the framework adds to the Langlands picture.*

## The central mystery, restated

The deepest fact about L-functions is that objects from completely different
branches of mathematics — geometry (étale cohomology), analysis (automorphic
forms), algebra (Galois representations), arithmetic (class field theory) —
all produce the same kind of analytic object. The Langlands programme is the
claim that this is not a coincidence: every *motivic* L-function (from geometry)
is an *automorphic* L-function (from harmonic analysis on a symmetric space).

In TRS language: **the same programme, evaluated over different semirings,
produces the same output.** This is semiring-polymorphism — the defining
property of the ISA trilogy — applied to number theory.

## Which ISA is which

| Mathematical object | ISA | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Étale cohomology $H^k(X, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)$ | Harmonic ISA | Global Frobenius eigenvalues via Hodge-theoretic relaxation on $X$ |
| Galois representation $\rho: \mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) \to GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ | Origami ISA | Discrete group action; tropical/combinatorial; argmax of Frobenius |
| Automorphic form / representation $\pi$ of $G(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q})$ | Meld ISA | Complex amplitudes; unitary representation; harmonic analysis on $G/K$ |
| Local factor $L_p(s, \pi_p) = \det(1 - a_p p^{-s})^{-1}$ | p-adic ISA | One factor per prime; Weil-Deligne representation over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ |
| Global L-function $L(s, \pi) = \prod_p L_p(s, \pi_p)$ | Adèlic ISA | Euler product over all primes = adèlic assembly |

**The Langlands correspondence** is the statement that the Harmonic ISA
computation (motivic side) and the Meld ISA computation (automorphic side)
produce the same L-function. In ISA terms: the adèlic programme is
semiring-polymorphic — it gives the same output whether you evaluate it over
the smooth Hodge semiring or the complex unitary semiring.

## The motivic side: Harmonic ISA

An L-function from geometry — say, the Hasse-Weil L-function of an elliptic
curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ — is built from the eigenvalues of Frobenius acting on
$H^1(E, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)$. This is a global computation:

$$L(s, E) = \prod_p \frac{1}{1 - a_p p^{-s} + p^{1-2s}}$$

where $a_p = p + 1 - \#E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is determined by counting points on
$E$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$ — a global topological invariant of $E$.

This is the **Harmonic ISA** at work:
- The input is the elliptic curve $E$ as a smooth geometric object
- The computation finds the harmonic spectrum of Frobenius (eigenvalues of the
  crystalline/étale cohomology)
- The output is the sequence $(a_p)_p$ — the "harmonic fingerprint" of $E$

The Harmonic ISA opcode correspondence:
- **SPLIT** → Künneth decomposition of $H^*(X \times Y)$
- **TWIST** → Tate twist $H^k(X)(n)$ (shifts the Hodge filtration)
- **FLIP** → Poincaré duality $H^k(X) \cong H^{2d-k}(X)(d)$
- **BIND** → Cup product in cohomology; the Lefschetz operator

---

## The automorphic side: Meld ISA

An automorphic form is a smooth function $f: G(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}) \to \mathbb{C}$
that is:
- Left-invariant under $G(\mathbb{Q})$ (arithmetic periodicity)
- Right-invariant under a maximal compact $K$ (geometric smoothness)
- An eigenfunction of all Hecke operators $T_p$ (spectral condition)

The automorphic L-function is built from the Hecke eigenvalues:

$$L(s, \pi) = \prod_p L(s, \pi_p)$$

This is the **Meld ISA** at work:
- The input is the symmetric space $G(\mathbb{A})/G(\mathbb{Q}) \cdot K$
- The computation decomposes $L^2$ of this space into irreducible
  representations (spectral decomposition — the Meld analogue of the QFT)
- The output is the automorphic representation $\pi$ and its L-function

The Meld ISA opcode correspondence:
- **SPLIT** → Spectral decomposition of $L^2(G(\mathbb{Q}) \backslash G(\mathbb{A}))$
- **SPLAT** → Projection onto a Hecke eigenspace (automorphic form)
- **TWIST** → Twisting by a Hecke character $\chi$: $\pi \mapsto \pi \otimes \chi$
- **FLOP** → Trace formula (Arthur-Selberg): $\sum_\pi = \sum_\gamma$
- **BIND** → Rankin-Selberg convolution $L(s, \pi \times \pi')$

## The p-adic local factors: p-adic ISA

At each prime $p$, the local L-factor $L_p(s, \pi_p)$ is determined by a
Weil-Deligne representation — a representation of the local Galois group
$\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p / \mathbb{Q}_p)$. This is the **p-adic ISA**:
the arithmetic at prime $p$ lives over $\mathbb{Q}_p$, not over $\mathbb{R}$
or $\mathbb{C}$.

The NTT (number-theoretic transform) connection: the Frobenius at $p$ acts on
the $p$-adic cohomology $H^k_{\mathrm{crys}}(X/W(\mathbb{F}_p))$ by an
operator whose eigenvalues are the Weil numbers $\alpha_p$ with
$|\alpha_p|_\infty = p^{k/2}$. This is the p-adic QFT — the NTT — at the
cohomological level. The Satake isomorphism (which identifies the Hecke
algebra with the representation ring of the Langlands dual group $G^\vee$)
is the p-adic version of the Fourier transform.

---

## The Galois side: Origami ISA

The Galois group $\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ acts on étale
cohomology by *discrete* automorphisms — it permutes the roots of polynomials,
it acts on torsion points of elliptic curves, it computes the Frobenius at
each prime. This is the **Origami ISA**: discrete, combinatorial, tropical.

The Langlands correspondence at the Galois level says: every $n$-dimensional
Galois representation $\rho$ comes from an automorphic representation $\pi$
of $GL_n(\mathbb{A})$. In ISA terms: every Origami-ISA programme (Galois
action) lifts to a Meld-ISA programme (automorphic form).

## The adèlic assembly: Ostrowski completeness

The global L-function is the **adèlic product**:

$$L(s, \pi) = L_\infty(s, \pi_\infty) \cdot \prod_p L_p(s, \pi_p)$$

where $L_\infty$ is the archimedean factor (from $\mathbb{R}$, via gamma functions)
and $L_p$ is the p-adic factor. This is the adèlic product formula — the
statement that the adèlic ISA over $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q} = \mathbb{R} \times \prod_p \mathbb{Q}_p$
assembles into a well-defined global object.

**Ostrowski's theorem** guarantees that this is complete: the only completions
of $\mathbb{Q}$ are $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for each prime $p$. The
adèlic L-function exhausts all possible arithmetic information about the
geometric object $X$. There is no other prime to check.

## The geometric Langlands programme

The *geometric* Langlands programme replaces:
- Number fields $\mathbb{Q}$ → function fields $\mathbb{F}_q(C)$ of a curve $C$
- Galois representations → local systems (flat $G$-bundles on $C$)
- Automorphic forms → $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the moduli stack $\mathrm{Bun}_G(C)$

In ISA terms:
- Local systems are **Meld ISA** objects: flat connections = parallel transport
  = Berry phase accumulation around loops on $C$
- $\mathcal{D}$-modules on $\mathrm{Bun}_G$ are **Harmonic ISA** objects:
  differential operators on the smooth moduli space

The geometric Langlands correspondence (proved for $GL_n$ by Frenkel-BenZvi,
and in the non-Abelian case by Laumon, Gaitsgory) is the statement that the
Harmonic ISA and Meld ISA computations on the *same* geometric input agree.
This is semiring-polymorphism in its purest form.

## The TRS contribution: what the ISA framework adds

The ISA framework does not prove the Langlands correspondence. But it reframes
it in a way that suggests new directions:

**1. The Langlands correspondence is a semiring-polymorphism theorem.**
The reason L-functions appear in both geometry and analysis is that both
are computing the same ISA programme — the harmonic spectrum of a symmetry
group acting on a space — evaluated over different semirings (Hodge vs.
complex unitary). The correspondence holds because the output (L-function)
is semiring-invariant.

**2. The Ramanujan conjecture is a statement about ISA tier.**
The Ramanujan conjecture (for $GL_2$: $|a_p| \leq 2\sqrt{p}$) says that
the Hecke eigenvalues of a cusp form lie in the *tempered* spectrum of
$GL_2(\mathbb{A})$. In ISA terms: the automorphic representation is at the
H¹ level (interference, unitary, tempered) rather than the H⁰ level
(tropical, degenerate, non-tempered). A non-tempered automorphic form would
be an H⁰ object masquerading as H¹ — a "dark" automorphic form in the
magic-theory sense.

**3. The $G_2$ case is special.** The TRS framework uses $G_2$ (the
automorphism group of the octonions) as its symmetry group. The $G_2$
Langlands dual is again $G_2$ (it is self-dual under the root-system
involution). This self-duality means the Langlands correspondence for $G_2$
is an *endomorphism* of the adèlic ISA — the motivic and automorphic sides
use the same group. Paper 492 (Langlands for Galois Chemistry) uses this
self-duality to read off molecular spectra from automorphic forms.

**4. The Bruhat-Tits building is the p-adic ISA geometry.**
The Bruhat-Tits building of $G_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is the tree that the
p-adic ISA traverses via BFS (Paper 546, x544d). At each prime $p$, the local
Langlands factor $L_p(s, \pi_p)$ is computed by walking this tree. The NTT
(p-adic QFT) is the Fourier transform on the building.
