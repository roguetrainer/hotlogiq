## Computation at finite temperature

Classical logic is the zero-temperature limit — frozen, deterministic, β→∞. Every `if` statement, every argmax, every hard decision boundary is what you get when you turn the heat all the way down. **Thermyon** is the framework for what happens when you turn it back up.

Your favourite large language model already runs at finite temperature. Softmax with temperature T is not a trick bolted onto neural networks — it is Gibbs sampling, the same Boltzmann distribution that governs a steam engine, a financial market, and an enzyme active site. Fuzzy has been the new computing paradigm for a while. Thermyon makes the mathematics explicit.

At finite β, probabilistic reasoning becomes Gibbs sampling. At imaginary β = it/ℏ, quantum interference appears — the Wick rotation that connects statistical mechanics to quantum mechanics is just β going complex. Near a critical point β\*, biological computation balances exploration against commitment: too cold and the enzyme is frozen in a local minimum, too hot and selectivity vanishes.

The name comes from **thermionic emission** — the process by which a heated cathode releases electrons, controlled by temperature and the Boltzmann factor e^{−βE}. A vacuum tube computes by managing thermal energy. So does Thermyon. β is the voltage; the five opcodes are the circuit.

**Thermyon** is built around a five-opcode instruction set — the **Origami ISA** — that runs at every temperature, over any arithmetic, under any symmetry group. The **Maslov–Gibbs Einsum (MGE)** makes β a differentiable coordinate: discrete combinatorial models become smooth functions of temperature, and the snap at β\* is a genuine phase transition, not a metaphor.

## The five opcodes

| Opcode | Symbol | Role | H^k tier |
|--------|--------|------|-----------|
| `LABEL` 🏷️ | ⊢ | Assign a symmetry sector / orbit label | H⁰ |
| `ORBIT` 🔄 | 𝒪 | Enumerate orbits under a group action | H⁰ |
| `FLIP` 👁️ | ⌁ | Sheaf dualisation / time-reversal | H⁰ |
| `TWIST` 🌀 | ∮ | Gauge transformation / phase accumulation | H¹ |
| `BIND` 💎 | ⋈ | Entanglement / correlation / Pachner surgery | H² |

The **Pentagon identity** (`d² = 0`) is simultaneously: the HJM no-arbitrage condition · the Biedenharn–Elliott identity for angular momentum recoupling · the MIP\* verifier constraint · the H² = 0 stability condition for financial cascades. One equation, four theorems.

## The β-deformation

The same five opcodes execute at every value of the inverse temperature β, producing specialised ISAs for each regime:

| ISA | β regime | Arithmetic | Character |
|-----|----------|------------|-----------|
| Tropical limit | β → ∞ | (max,+) | Classical logic, argmax, discrete optimisation |
| **Forge** | 0 < β < ∞ (real) | Gibbs / ℝ | Statistical mechanics, soft thresholds, annealing |
| **Meld** | β = it/ℏ | Unitary / ℂ | Quantum mechanics, interference, Feynman path integral |
| Raven | β ≈ β\* | Near-critical | Biological computation, kinetic proofreading, H² QEC |
| Hum | β = it/ℏ (QFT) | (ℂ, EMIT) | Quantum field theory, amplituhedron |
| **Origami** | all β | Fibred family | Five-opcode open standard; umbrella for all regimes |

Lowering β is quantisation; raising β is the classical limit. Planck's constant, viscosity, volatility, softmax temperature, and the quantum-group deformation parameter q = e^{iπβ} are all the same object seen from different fields.

## Universality table

The same five opcodes appear across twenty orders of magnitude in scale:

| System | H⁰ | H¹ | Pentagon = H² |
|--------|----|----|---------------|
| Nuclear spectroscopy | Selection rules | Racah 6j symbol | Biedenharn–Elliott |
| FMO light harvesting | Site energies | Transfer efficiency η = 0.1828 | Carnot bound |
| Quantum computing | Pauli syndromes | Magic valence | MIP\* = RE |
| Three-body orbits | Kepler solutions | Choreographic solutions | KZ equations |
| Interest rates | Bilateral prices | Convexity (HJM drift) | HJM no-arbitrage |
| Systemic risk | Bilateral stress | Triangular contagion | H² = 0 stability |
| Molecular chemistry | Ground-state NOON | Correlation (Weyl c₂) | G-step reaction |

This is not analogy. It is the same theorem — the 6j symbol is H¹ of the relevant representation sheaf — instantiated for different sheaves over different interaction diagrams.
