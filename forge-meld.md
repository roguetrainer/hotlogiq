# The Forge and Meld ISAs
{: .no_toc }

*The Origami ISA runs at β → ∞: frozen, tropical, classical. The Forge ISA runs at
finite real β: thermodynamic, exploratory, statistical. The Meld ISA is the Wick
rotation β = it: complex amplitudes, interference, quantum. All three precipitate
from a single smooth containing structure — the Ambient — which is not itself an ISA
but the manifold in which all three live.*

## The β parameter

β is the **inverse temperature** of the ISA. It is the single dial that controls
which arithmetic the opcodes run over:

$$\pi_k(\beta) = \frac{e^{-\beta E_k}}{\sum_j e^{-\beta E_j}}$$

This is the **Maslov-Gibbs Einsum (MGE)** — the core operation of the entire
framework ([Paper 201](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17981393)). The β parameter
has two natural extensions from the real positive axis:

| β | Arithmetic | ISA | Regime |
|---|-----------|-----|--------|
| $\beta \to \infty$ | Tropical $(\max,+)$ | Origami | Frozen; classical; discrete logic |
| $0 < \beta < \infty$ | Real Gibbs ($\mathbb{R}_{>0}$) | Forge | Statistical; thermodynamic; snap at $\beta^*$ |
| $\beta = it$ | Complex ($\mathbb{C}$) | Meld | Quantum; interference; unitary |
| $\beta \to 0$ | Uniform; smooth Hodge | *The Ambient* | Containing manifold; not an ISA |

The three ISAs are not three different instruction sets — they are the same opcodes
evaluated over three different semirings. The Ambient is not an ISA at all; it is
the smooth manifold from which all three are carved.

---

## The Origami ISA: β → ∞

As β → ∞ the Gibbs softmax collapses to the tropical argmax:

$$\lim_{\beta\to\infty} \frac{e^{-\beta E_k}}{\sum_j e^{-\beta E_j}} = \begin{cases} 1 & k = \arg\min_j E_j \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

This is the **tropical $(\max,+)$ semiring**: addition becomes max, multiplication
becomes addition. Polynomial equations become piecewise-linear; algebraic varieties
become polyhedral fans. The Origami ISA is deterministic, classical logic — the
zero-temperature limit in which the system always picks the lowest-energy path.

**The Origami ISA is the tropical crystal precipitated from the Ambient.** Every
discrete opcode is what survives when the smooth Ambient is frozen to zero temperature.
This is the direction of the relationship: smooth first, discrete as a limit.

---

## The Forge ISA: 0 < β < ∞

At finite β the system explores: lower-energy paths are favoured, but higher-energy
paths still have nonzero weight. This is **thermodynamic computation**.

The Forge ISA ([Paper 419](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20694527)) is the
statistical regime of the ISA trilogy. Its key features:

**The vorton architecture.** The Forge ISA executes programmes on *vortons* —
topological excitations that carry angular momentum and persist as metastable states
at finite temperature. A vorton is a TWIST-stabilised excitation: it exists because
the ribbon element θ_V has nonzero amplitude at finite β. At β → ∞ (Origami),
vortons freeze into classical spin states. At β → 0 they dissolve back into the
Ambient — the high-entropy limit where all paths are equally weighted.

**The snap event.** As β rises through the threshold β*, the MGE undergoes a
spontaneous **phase transition** — a *snap* — from exploratory (soft) to
crystallised (hard) weighting:

$$\beta^* = \frac{3}{8} \ln\!\frac{1}{1-\rho}$$

where ρ is the edge density of the interaction graph. Below β* the system is in
the H¹ regime — diffuse, exploring, statistically correctable. At β* it crosses
into H⁰ — crystallised, deterministic, classical. The snap event is TWIST failure:
the quantum dimension $d_{1/2}(\beta) = 2\cos(\pi\beta)$ reaches zero at
$\beta^* = \tfrac{1}{2}$ (the BKT transition in the SU(2)_q family).

**Auto-annealing.** The Forge ISA does not require an external annealing schedule.
The G₂ geometry of the interaction tensor self-organises: geometric frustration
spikes the energy $E_k$ during chaotic exploration, causing Boltzmann freeze-out;
at convergence the frustration dissolves and routing relaxes back to uniform.

**The β-ladder.** The snap threshold β* acts as a universal phase boundary:

| β | $\alpha$-connection | Phase | ISA state |
|---|---------------------|-------|-----------|
| $\beta \to 0$ | $\alpha = +1$ ($e$-flat) | Maximum entropy | The Ambient |
| $0 < \beta < \beta^*$ | $0 < \alpha < 1$ | Exploratory | H¹ / Forge (below snap) |
| $\beta = \beta^*$ | $\alpha = 0$ (Levi-Civita) | BKT / curvature maximum | Snap boundary |
| $\beta > \beta^*$ | $-1 < \alpha < 0$ | Crystallising | H⁰ / Origami approach |
| $\beta \to \infty$ | $\alpha = -1$ ($m$-flat) | Classical / tropical | H⁰ / Origami |

---

## The Meld ISA: β = it

The **Wick rotation** $\beta \to it$ leaves the real axis entirely and enters the
complex plane:

$$e^{-\beta E_k} \xrightarrow{\;\beta = it\;} e^{-itE_k}$$

This is the Schrödinger equation. Real Boltzmann weights become complex amplitudes;
statistical mechanics becomes quantum mechanics; the Forge ISA becomes the
**Meld ISA** ([Paper 454](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20773563)).

The Wick rotation is not an analogy — it is an exact algebraic substitution in the
MGE. Every Forge ISA programme has a Meld version obtained by replacing β with it.
The MGE becomes a unitary evolution operator; the partition function becomes the
path integral; the snap threshold β* becomes the boundary between thermal and
quantum fluctuation dominance.

**What the Wick rotation does to each opcode:**

| Opcode | Forge (real β) | Meld (β = it) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| SPLIT | Gibbs fan-out; soft copy | Unitary fan-out; QFT mode splitting |
| SPLAT | Gibbs projection; soft measurement | Born rule measurement |
| TWIST | Thermal phase $e^{-\beta\theta}$ | Quantum phase $e^{-it\theta}$; Berry phase |
| FLIP | Real time-reversal | Anti-unitary time-reversal; Kramers |
| FLOP | Partition function trace | Quantum trace; path integral |
| BIND | Thermal recoupling | Unitary $F$-matrix; non-Abelian anyon braiding |

**The T-gate is the Meld-only opcode.** The T-gate — the gate that promotes
Clifford circuits to universal quantum computation — cannot be expressed as a real
Gibbs weight at any β. Its phase $e^{i\pi/4}$ is what the Wick rotation
$\beta \to it$ introduces and the real axis cannot supply. In ISA terms, the
T-gate is a TWIST opcode carrying a complex phase invisible to the Forge regime.

**Clifford vs magic: a phase ladder.** The Clifford group uses only phases that
are 4th roots of unity — $\{1, i, -1, -i\}$, multiples of $e^{i\pi/2}$. These
are classically simulable (Gottesman-Knill). The T-gate introduces $e^{i\pi/4}$,
an 8th root of unity: outside the Clifford phase group, hence *magic*. The
general principle is that phases $e^{i\pi k/2^n}$ — rational multiples of π at
finer and finer fractions — climb a ladder of increasing magic content. Irrational
phases (e.g. $e^{i\theta}$, $\theta/\pi \notin \mathbb{Q}$) sit at the top: they
cannot be built from any finite gate set and are never reached by a finite circuit.
Universal quantum computation needs only one step up this ladder — from 4th to 8th
roots of unity — which is what the T-gate provides.

BIND at the octonion / $G_2$ rung is a *stronger* structure needed for
**topological quantum computation** — fault-tolerant universality via Fibonacci
anyons and non-Abelian braiding. This is the 731-ISA extension, not standard
qubit universality. Building an octonionic quantum computer would require
physical hardware that braids non-Abelian anyons — a technology that does not yet
exist in any laboratory. The two levels are:

| Level | Gates | BIND rung | Universality | Fault tolerance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard QC | Clifford + T | SU(2), $j=1/2$ (associative) | Yes (BQP) | Requires error correction |
| Topological QC | Clifford + Fibonacci braid | $G_2$ / octonion (non-associative) | Yes (BQP) | Built-in (anyon braiding) |

The 731-ISA reaches the second level. Standard Meld ISA suffices for the first.

## The Ambient: β → 0

The Ambient is not an ISA. It is the **smooth containing manifold** from which
all three ISAs are carved — the Platonic original of which Origami, Forge, and
Meld are shadows cast in different directions.

As β → 0 the Gibbs weights become uniform: every path has equal weight, no
preference, maximum entropy. This is not a computational regime you *inhabit* —
you cannot run programmes at β = 0 because no decisions are ever made. But it is
the structure that gives the trilogy its geometry.

**Why it matters:**

- The Origami ISA is the **tropical crystal precipitated from the Ambient** as
  β → ∞ freezes the smooth measure to an argmax. Every discrete algorithm is the
  degeneration of a smooth problem that lives naturally in the Ambient.
- The Forge ISA is the **thermodynamic engine between the Ambient and the crystal**
  — the regime where the transition from smooth to discrete can be controlled and
  exploited via β.
- The Meld ISA is a **Wick slice through the Ambient** — rotating β into the
  complex plane picks out the quantum-mechanical structure latent in the smooth
  manifold.

**What lives in the Ambient:**

- Hodge theory — the smooth H^k cohomology of which the Forge/Origami ladder is
  the discretisation
- Optimal transport and Sinkhorn scaling — Forge programmes that approach the
  Ambient as regularisation → 0
- Diffusion models and score matching — operate at β → 0 and sharpen iteratively
  toward discrete outputs
- Continuous relaxations of combinatorial problems — LP and SDP relaxations are
  Ambient-level approaches to Origami problems

The Ambient does not yet have a dedicated paper. It is named and defined here for
the first time as the smooth β → 0 limit of the MGE, the containing manifold of
the ISA trilogy.

## The full picture

The three ISAs and the Ambient live in the **complex β-plane** — a single
structure indexed by β ∈ ℂ ([Paper 543](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17981393)):

               β→0    (0 < β < ∞)       (β → ∞, tropical)
```

Each prime p adds a **p-adic axis** into the β-plane, carrying the p-adic ISA
(U-MGE over ℤ_p, NTT as QFT, Hensel lifting as optimisation). The full
**adèlic β-plane** has one real axis and one p-adic axis per prime:

| β | Arithmetic | ISA | Key operation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\beta \to \infty$ | Tropical $(\max,+)$ | Origami | Argmax; discrete logic |
| $0 < \beta < \infty$ | Gibbs ($\mathbb{R}_{>0}$) | Forge | Snap at $\beta^*$; annealing |
| $\beta = it$ | Complex ($\mathbb{C}$) | Meld | Unitary; T-gate; interference |
| $\beta \to 0$ | Uniform; Hodge | *The Ambient* | Containing manifold; not an ISA |
| $\beta \in \mathbb{Q}_p$ | p-adic ($\mathbb{Z}_p$) | U-MGE / p-adic ISA | NTT = QFT; Hensel = VQE |
| $\beta \in \mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}$ | Adèlic ($\mathbb{A}$) | Adèlic ISA | All primes simultaneously |

**Which ISA should I use?**

- **Origami** — discrete, combinatorial, zero temperature. Protein structure
  (Ramachandran), nuclear spectroscopy, classical algorithms.
- **Forge** — probabilistic, thermodynamic, finite temperature. Annealing,
  belief propagation, kinetic proofreading. Snap at β* separates H¹ from H⁰.
- **Meld** — quantum, unitary. QFT, anyons, Shor's algorithm, magic state
  distillation. Requires BIND for universality (T-gate).
- **p-adic ISA** — exact integer arithmetic, ultrametric geometry. Lattice-based
  cryptography (NTT), p-adic VQE (Hensel lifting), p-adic Grover.

The 731-ISA extends the diagram along a third axis — *associativity* — adding
the BIND opcode and reaching the 𝕆-rung. See
[The Non-Associative Frontier](non-associative-frontier.md).

**Ostrowski's theorem** guarantees completeness: the only completions of ℚ are
ℝ and ℚ_p. The adèlic product ℝ × ∏_p ℚ_p contains every possible β. The ISA
trilogy plus the p-adic ISAs form a *complete* set of arithmetic modes — there
is no other place for β to live.
