## The unmistakable hum of empty space

Willis Lamb called it "the unmistakable hum of empty space." In 1947 he measured a tiny shift in the hydrogen spectrum — 1058 MHz between two energy levels that classical quantum mechanics said should be identical. This Lamb shift is the first experimental signature of quantum field theory: the vacuum is not empty. It hums.

The **Hum ISA** is the ISA that describes quantum field theory. It extends the Meld ISA by one opcode — EMIT — and rotates β to the imaginary axis at the quantum field theory scale: β = it/ℏ where t is physical time.

---

## The one new opcode: EMIT

The Meld ISA (quantum mechanics of a fixed number of particles) has five opcodes. Quantum field theory needs one more: **EMIT**, the vertex at which a particle couples to a field mode.

EMIT is the Feynman vertex: the point where an electron emits a photon, where a quark emits a gluon, where a Higgs couples to a W boson. Without EMIT, you can describe how particles propagate (TWIST 🌀, ORBIT 🔄) and how they entangle (BIND 💎), but you cannot describe how they interact by exchanging field quanta.

The Lamb shift is caused by the electron emitting and reabsorbing virtual photons — EMIT followed by EMIT†. The 1058 MHz hum is the quantum field theory correction to the electron's self-energy: an EMIT loop in the Hum ISA programme for hydrogen.

## The amplituhedron as ORBIT 🔄

One of the deepest results in the Hum ISA: **the amplituhedron is an ORBIT closure**.

The amplituhedron (Arkani-Hamed and Trnka, 2013) is a geometric object in Grassmannian space whose volume computes scattering amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. The Feynman diagram expansion — summing over all virtual particle paths — is replaced by a single geometric computation: find the volume of the amplituhedron.

In ISA terms: the amplituhedron is the ORBIT of the scattering configuration under the Yangian symmetry group. Computing the scattering amplitude is computing ORBIT[EMIT](q) — the partition function of EMIT opcodes weighted by the Yangian action. The amplituhedron's geometric simplicity is the ISA's ORBIT opcode made visible.

## QFT as a Hum ISA programme

Every quantum field theory calculation is a Hum ISA programme:

| QFT concept | Hum ISA |
|------------|---------|
| Free field propagator | TWIST 🌀 (phase accumulation along worldline) |
| Vertex / interaction | EMIT |
| Loop integral | ORBIT 🔄 (closed loop in momentum space) |
| Renormalisation | ORBIT 🔄 at the UV fixed point |
| Feynman diagram | Hum programme with EMIT vertices |
| Path integral | MGE over all Hum programmes |
| Scattering amplitude | ORBIT[EMIT](q) evaluated at β = it/ℏ |

The perturbative expansion in the coupling constant g is the expansion of ORBIT[EMIT](q) in powers of EMIT — each Feynman diagram is one term.

## The β = it/ℏ rotation

The Hum ISA operates at β = it/ℏ: the Wick rotation of the Forge ISA from real to imaginary time. This turns:
- Boltzmann weights exp(−βE) → phase factors exp(−iEt/ℏ) ✓
- Thermal fluctuations → quantum fluctuations ✓  
- Statistical partition function → quantum path integral ✓
- Gibbs entropy → von Neumann entropy ✓

The Lamb shift, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (g-2), the Casimir effect, and asymptotic freedom are all corrections computed in the Hum ISA at one-loop (one ORBIT 🔄 closure around one EMIT vertex).

## Why "Hum"

Willis Lamb: "the unmistakable hum of empty space." The hum is the vacuum fluctuation — the EMIT loop that never stops, even in the ground state. The Hum ISA is named for this: the constant background computation of the quantum vacuum, running EMIT programmes at every point in spacetime, producing the hum that Lamb heard in 1947 as a 1058 MHz shift.
