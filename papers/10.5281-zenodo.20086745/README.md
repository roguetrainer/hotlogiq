## Abstract

Introduces the Unitary Resonance Network (URN), a neural architecture that replaces Euclidean parameter spaces with bounded hypercomplex domains governed by Möbius automorphisms. The URN resolves the Fine-Tuning Trilemma — the conflict between plasticity, stability, and efficiency — via two mechanisms: (1) Möbius automorphisms bypass Liouville's theorem, enabling the network to function as a Blum-Shub-Smale (BSS) machine over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$; (2) the Fano-Fisher Topological Immune System projects fine-tuning gradients onto the 10-dimensional Information Valley (null space of $\Psi$), while thermodynamically barricading the 4-dimensional Information Ridge ($E_k = 8/3$). This prevents catastrophic forgetting by categorical geometric exclusion, not soft regularisation.

## Key Results

- **Topological Immune System**: gradient projection onto the G₂ null space enforces zero skeleton drift ($\|\delta_{\mathrm{ridge}}\| < 10^{-15}$) by construction.
- **Experiment 9**: Standard SGD: Task A retention 5.0% after fine-tuning. URN immune filter: Task A retention 100.0%, Task B learning 74.1%. Ridge drift NAIG: $7 \times 10^{-16}$ (machine precision).
- **Trilemma resolution**: plasticity retained in the 10D valley; stability enforced in the 4D ridge; no additional parameters required.
- **V31 taxonomy**: 111-URN ($SU(1,1)$, complex), 331-URN ($Sp(1,1)$, quaternionic), 731-URN ($F_{4(-20)}$, octonionic) — each tier unlocks a larger bounded domain.

## Fine-Tuning Trilemma

| Constraint | Standard SGD | EWC (Kirkpatrick) | URN Immune Filter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plasticity | ✓ | Partial | ✓ (10D valley free) |
| Stability | ✗ | Soft penalty | ✓ (4D ridge excluded) |
| Efficiency | ✓ | Extra Fisher term | ✓ (projection only) |
