## Eight Famous Algorithms Are the Same Algorithm

## The central idea in one sentence

Elastic hashing, matrix multiplication tiling, max-flow, cache coherence, SLAM loop closure, the Mittag-Leffler theorem, distributed consensus, and persistent homology are all the same computation — they differ only in what they are computing *over*, not in what they are doing.

---

## The pattern they all share

Each of these algorithms tries to assemble **locally consistent data into a globally consistent whole**. In each case:

- Local data exists and is individually fine
- The trouble comes when assembling it globally
- The assembly fails when a certain **obstruction** — measured by the first sheaf cohomology group $H^1$ — is non-zero
- Performance degrades in proportion to how large $H^1$ is
- The algorithm succeeds by applying **coboundary corrections** that keep $H^1$ small

This is not an analogy. It is the same mathematical theorem — the Čech cohomology exact sequence — instantiated in eight different domains.

## The five opcodes

Every one of the eight algorithms uses exactly the same five operations, just applied to different objects:

| Opcode | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **SPLIT** | Creates a local section | Insert a key / push flow / write to cache |
| **SPLAT** | Evaluates a local section | Look up a key / measure flow conservation |
| **FLOP** | Kills one $H^1$ class | Firebreak / augmenting path / invalidation message |
| **TWIST** | Gauge transformation | Relabel without changing the $H^1$ class |
| **FLIP** | Hodge star / duality | Flow reversal / Poincaré duality |

The correctness condition in every domain is the same equation: **SPLAT∘SPLIT = 0** (the Pentagon identity, $d^2 = 0$). This is simultaneously flow conservation, cache coherence, consensus safety, the Čech cocycle condition, and the topological boundary condition $\partial^2 = 0$ in persistent homology.

---

## Why this matters: the temperature parameter

In every domain, there is a natural **temperature** $\beta$ that controls how aggressively corrections are applied:

- $\beta = 0$: greedy — no corrections, $H^1$ grows freely, performance degrades
- $\beta \to \infty$: fully elastic — maximum corrections, $H^1$ stays small, optimal performance

The paper conjectures that the critical temperature — the minimum $\beta$ needed to keep $H^1$ bounded — is universal:

$$\beta^*(\rho) = \frac{3}{8} \ln\!\left(\frac{1}{1-\rho}\right)$$

where $\rho$ is the load factor. This formula was previously derived for the broken-Fano thermodynamic engine (Paper 325); its appearance across eight unrelated domains suggests it is a fundamental constant of local-to-global assembly algorithms.

---

## Three new engineering proposals

The unification immediately suggests importing techniques across domains:

- **β-Raft**: probabilistic distributed consensus — accept a proposal with probability $\propto e^{-\beta \cdot H^1_\mathrm{local}}$, trading consistency probability for throughput
- **Elastic cache coherence**: load-adaptive write-combining buffers with threshold $\sim \log^2(\text{cache size})/(1-\text{pressure})$
- **β-SLAM**: trigger loop closure selectively when accumulated drift exceeds $\beta^*(\rho)$, preventing incorrect closures from corrupting the global pose graph
