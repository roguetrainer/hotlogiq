## The Orbit Processing Unit: a new class of processor for correlated problems

*Plain-language explainer for [doi:10.5281/zenodo.21360838](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21360838) (#598)*

## The central image

A classical computer writes symbols onto a one-dimensional tape. An Orbit Processing Unit (OPU) writes onto a curved surface — the **Grassmannian** Gr(k,n), the space of all k-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space.

The Grassmannian is not an exotic abstraction. It is the natural state space for any problem that involves choosing an active subspace: quantum chemistry's active-space selection, scattering amplitude computation, topological phase classification, and kinetic proofreading all live naturally on Gr(k,n). The OPU reads and writes this space directly, rather than simulating it from a flat tape.

## The problem with flat tapes

A molecule with 50 orbitals has a wavefunction that lives in a Hilbert space of dimension ~10¹⁴. Writing it onto a flat tape requires listing all 10¹⁴ coefficients. That is the exponential wall of classical quantum chemistry.

Current methods (CASSCF, CASPT2, MRCI) avoid this by choosing a small **active space** — a k-dimensional subspace of the n available orbitals. This reduces the problem to Gr(k,n), which has C(n,k) distinct "cells" (Schubert cells), each representing a qualitatively different correlation regime. For CASSCF(10,10): C(10,10) = 252 cells instead of 10¹⁰ basis functions.

What was missing: a formal name for the processor that operates on this space, a canonical alphabet (the cells), a canonical memory register, and a canonical halting condition. This paper provides all four.

---

## The Schubert cell alphabet

The Grassmannian Gr(k,n) has a natural cell decomposition — the **Schubert cells** — indexed by Young diagrams with at most k rows and (n−k) columns. For Gr(2,4) (the two-orbital active space relevant to H₂), there are C(4,2) = 6 cells:

| Cell | NOON signature | Chemistry | ISA opcode |
|------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| ∅ (top cell) | σ₀² ≈ 1 | Hartree-Fock reference | ORBIT (H⁰) |
| □ | σ₀² ∈ (0.88, 1) | Weak correlation | TWIST (H¹) |
| □□ | σ₀² ≈ 0.5 | Fully correlated | BIND (H²) |

Moving between cells is the OPU head transition. The ORBIT opcode moves within a cell (orbital rotation without cell-crossing); TWIST crosses the H⁰/H¹ boundary; BIND crosses into H² territory where classical simulation fails.

---

## The NOON spectrum as memory

The OPU's memory register is the **NOON spectrum** — the natural orbital occupation numbers {σ₀², σ₁², …, σ_{k-1}²} obtained by diagonalising the one-particle density matrix. These are the singular values of the active-space coefficient matrix, squared.

Three key properties make the NOON spectrum the right memory:

1. **Basis-independent** — the NOON values do not change when you rotate the orbital basis. They are a property of the physical state, not the representation.
2. **Directly observable** — NOONs are measurable by photon counting, NMR, or STM. No full wavefunction reconstruction needed.
3. **Classifies the correlation regime** — σ₀² ≈ 1: uncorrelated (H⁰); σ₀² ∈ (0.88, 1): weakly correlated (H¹); σ₀² < 0.88: strongly correlated (H²). This is the C/T classification of Papers 560/596.

The OPU reads the NOON spectrum at each step, uses it to determine which Schubert cell it is in, and halts when the spectrum stabilises.

## The β* snap: a canonical halting condition

The OPU halts when σ₀² crosses the threshold 0.88 — the **β* snap**. Below this threshold, the system has entered the H² Schubert stratum, where:

- DFT fails (the derivative discontinuity is a topological boundary, not a basis-set error — see Paper 596)
- Classical simulation of the full active space becomes exponentially hard
- BIND opcodes are required — quantum hardware is needed

Above the threshold, CASSCF (= an OPU emulator running on GPU via batched SVD + GEMM) is sufficient. The snap at σ₀² = 0.88 is not a numerical parameter — it is the Schubert variety boundary in Gr(k,n): the locus where two Schubert cells meet and the geodesic between them changes qualitative character.

For H₂ dissociation, this snap occurs at R* ≈ 1.7–1.8 Å — precisely where DFT errors exceed 5 kcal/mol (confirmed in Paper 596 experiment x596d).

## Nature already builds OPUs

The OPU is not a proposed device. Several natural systems are already running OPU programmes:

**FeMoco (nitrogenase active site):** A physical Gr(3,7) OPU — the special case where the Grassmannian has G₂ symmetry (the Fano plane). N₂ fixation requires 3 BIND operations in the OPU programme. The protein scaffold enforces the geodesic from [Fe-N₂] to [Fe-2NH₃] on Gr(14, n_orb) via parallel transport. Runs at 300 K with no decoherence problem because the relevant holonomy is geometric, not quantum-phase-coherent in the fragile sense.

**DNA polymerase III / ribosome:** Both run the ISA's IG Carnot cycle on the Grassmannian of substrate orbital geometries. The ribosome's codon-anticodon check is a Gr(3,6) discrimination (three independent 2-dimensional orbital matchings). Error rate < 10⁻⁴ per residue = OPU operating above β*.

**FMO light harvesting complex:** A Gr(1,7) OPU with the 6-731 topology. Exciton transfer efficiency η ≈ 18% follows from the IG Carnot bound on Gr(1,7) with one broken coupling line.

## The RPU family: where the OPU sits

The OPU is one member of the **RPU (Resonance Processing Unit)** family (Paper 205):

| Processor | Tape manifold | Acting group | β regime | Distinguishing structure |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------|--------------------------|
| QPU | Full Hilbert space CP^{2^n−1} | U(2^n) | β = it | Unitary, interference |
| **OPU** | **Gr(k,n)** | **U(n)** | **finite β** | **Schubert cells, NOON spectrum** |
| PPU | Bruhat-Tits tree | PGL(2,ℚ_p) | p-adic β | Ultrametric, NTT |
| Lie group RPU | G | G | finite β | Root vectors, Cartan algebra |

All RPUs share the same ISA (ORBIT/TWIST/BIND) and the same IG Carnot thermodynamics. What differs is the manifold — which determines the alphabet, memory register, and halting condition. The Grassmannian's distinguishing feature is the Schubert structure: it is the only natural state space that combines a canonical cell decomposition with a canonical singular-value memory.

## GPU emulation: what works and what does not

Current CASSCF codes (PySCF, GAMESS, ORCA) are implicit OPU emulators. The mapping:

| OPU opcode | ISA meaning | GPU primitive |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| SPLIT | Schmidt decomposition | batched SVD (`cuSOLVER gesvd`) |
| ORBIT | Geodesic step on Gr(k,n) | matrix exponential (cuBLAS Padé) |
| TWIST | Berry phase accumulation | det(U†V) phase (cuBLAS) |
| LABEL | Halt check: σ₀² > 0.88? | threshold on NOON |
| SPLAT | CI coefficient update | batched GEMM (cuBLAS) |

H⁰ and H¹ operations are GPU-emulable efficiently. The hard boundary is BIND (H²): tracking a full loop in Gr(k,n) with phase coherence requires either exponential precision or quantum hardware. This is the same barrier as the T-gate in fault-tolerant quantum computing — not a coincidence, since T-gate injection is a Schubert variety crossing in the quantum circuit Grassmannian.

---

## Turing completeness

The OPU is Turing-complete on sufficiently large Gr(k,n) by the same argument as Tao's Navier-Stokes result (Paper 512):

- Each Schubert cell = a tape symbol (C(n,k) symbols total)
- Each Schubert calculus product (Littlewood-Richardson rule) = a head transition
- The β* snap = the halt condition

Honest caveat: complexity is conserved, not eliminated. Exponential time on a classical tape becomes exponential precision in specifying the geodesic on Gr(k,n). The OPU is not a polynomial-time machine for NP-hard problems. Its advantage is specifically for problems *already defined on Gr(k,n)*, where the classical simulation requires simulating the Grassmannian geometry from a flat tape — an unnecessary overhead.

---

## The dictionary

| Classical Turing | OPU / Grassmannian tape |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Tape alphabet {0,1} | Schubert cells of Gr(k,n) |
| Head state | k-plane V ∈ Gr(k,n) |
| Tape symbol → state transition | Schubert calculus product (LR rule) |
| Halting state | Schubert variety crossing (β* snap) |
| Memory register | NOON spectrum {σ₀², …, σ_{k−1}²} |
| Computation | Parallel transport on Gr(k,n) accumulating Berry phase |
