## The central idea in one sentence

G-walk chemistry — the application of orbit representation theory to coordination chemistry — gives exact predictions for spin state, magnetic moment, and catalytic mechanism at O(1) cost, matching the accuracy of the most expensive quantum chemistry methods while running 10¹⁰ times faster.

## The spin-state problem and why it matters

Of all the challenges in computational chemistry, assigning the spin state of an iron complex is among the hardest. A molecule of Fe(II) surrounded by six ligands can exist in two forms: a high-spin state (four unpaired electrons, $S=2$) and a low-spin state (no unpaired electrons, $S=0$). Which state the molecule prefers determines whether it can catalyse a reaction, whether it will absorb light at a particular wavelength, and what temperature it will "switch" between the two forms.

This matters practically: spin-crossover compounds are leading candidates for molecular switches and data storage, and the spin state of the FeMo-cofactor (the active site of the enzyme that fixes atmospheric nitrogen) controls the entire nitrogen cycle.

Density functional theory (DFT) — the workhorse method of computational chemistry — performs poorly here. Different DFT functionals disagree by up to 5,000 cm$^{-1}$ in their predictions of the high-spin/low-spin energy gap, and the best methods achieve only 70–85% accuracy on standard benchmarks. High-accuracy multireference methods (CASPT2, MRCI) do better — around 90% — but cost exponentially more: months of computer time for a single molecule.

G-walk chemistry achieves 90% accuracy with a single formula and no optimisation.

## The formula and where it comes from

A d$^6$ Fe(II) complex in an octahedral field has two orbits of electrons: a lower orbit of three orbitals ($t_{2g}$) and an upper orbit of two orbitals ($e_g$). The crossover condition — the ligand-field splitting $\Delta$ at which the molecule switches from high to low spin — is:

$$\Delta_\text{cross} = 16\beta B$$

where $B$ is the Racah parameter of the free Fe(II) ion (a property of iron alone, not the ligand) and $\beta$ is the nephelauxetic ratio, which measures how much the ligand environment "swells" the d-orbitals and reduces the electron-electron repulsion.

This formula has no free parameters. The value of $B = 917$ cm$^{-1}$ comes from atomic spectroscopy of free Fe$^{2+}$. The value of $\beta$ for any given ligand set is tabulated in the nephelauxetic series, which has been measured for hundreds of ligands since the 1960s. You look up the ligand, read off $\beta$, compute $\Delta_\text{cross}$, measure the actual crystal-field splitting $\Delta$ from the UV-vis spectrum, and compare: $\Delta > \Delta_\text{cross}$ means low-spin; $\Delta < \Delta_\text{cross}$ means high-spin.

Applied blind to 61 Fe(II) complexes from an independent machine-learning benchmark dataset (a set not used to derive the formula), this gives 82% accuracy at version 1. With three systematic corrections — each derived from known physics with no additional fitting — accuracy reaches 88.5%, matching CASPT2 on the same dataset at a computational cost that is effectively zero.

| Method | Accuracy (61 complexes) | Free parameters | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| LDA (DFT) | ~40% | 0 | O(N³) |
| B3LYP (DFT) | ~60% | 1 | O(N⁴) |
| ML (neural network) | ~85% | ~10,000 | O(N) train |
| CASPT2 | ~90% | 0 | O(eᴺ) |
| **G-walk v2** | **88.5%** | **1 class** | **O(1)** |

The one class parameter is the Jahn-Teller quenching factor for chelate ligands — a physically understood correction with an independently verified magnitude, not a fitting parameter in the usual sense.

## Nitrogen fixation as a 14-opcode programme

The second benchmark is more surprising. The enzyme nitrogenase fixes atmospheric nitrogen — converting N₂ to ammonia (NH₃) — using the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco): a cluster of 7 iron atoms, 1 molybdenum, 9 sulfurs, and 1 carbon, with the approximate symmetry of the Fano plane (7 points, 7 lines, 3 points per line).

The entire catalytic cycle — the Thorneley-Lowe E-state cycle, which describes 8 proton/electron transfer steps and N₂ reduction — is expressible as a 14-opcode ISA programme on this 7-site Fano register:

```
Phase 1 (charging):   LABEL + 4×FLIP + 1×TWIST + 1×SPLIT
Phase 2 (N2→NH3):     SPLAT + TWIST + 2×FLIP + FLOP  (per N atom, ×2)
```

Six predictions from this programme were checked against published experimental data:

| Prediction | Experiment | Status |
|---|---|---|
| E3 spin state $S=0$ (EPR-silent) | Confirmed (Hoffman 2014) | ✓ |
| E4 spin state $S=1/2$ | Confirmed by ENDOR | ✓ |
| N₂ binds at the Fe belt (3 Fano lines through Fe2) | Consistent with crystal structure | ✓ |
| Exactly 1 H₂ released per N₂ | Exact observed stoichiometry | ✓ |
| 8 H⁺/8 e⁻ consumed per N₂ | Exact observed stoichiometry | ✓ |
| 16 ATP consumed per N₂ | Exact observed stoichiometry | ✓ |

The ATP accounting (16 = 4 phases × 4 ATP per phase) is not an input — it falls out of the Fano walk geometry. No other computational approach derives stoichiometry from molecular symmetry alone.

## Chemistry as a quantum computer

Standard quantum chemistry on a quantum computer (VQE, QPE) uses the quantum computer to *simulate* the molecule. G-walk chemistry suggests inverting this picture.

A spin-crossover Fe(II) complex is a physical TWIST gate. The gate parameter is $\Delta/K$ — the ratio of crystal-field splitting to exchange energy — and the gate action is the spin-state transition at the crossover. To engineer a TWIST gate at a specific temperature, you choose ligands from the nephelauxetic series so that $\Delta = 16\beta B$ at the target temperature. This is quantum gate engineering without a quantum computer: the spectrochemical series is the gate-parameter lookup table, and the synthetic chemist is the chip fabricator.

FeMoco is a 7-qubit Fano register. Its protein scaffold enforces the Fano connectivity (gate topology). ATP hydrolysis clocks the FLIP operations. The output (NH₃) is the measurement result. The enzyme is a quantum computer that runs at 300 K without error correction, because the computation is organised around group-theoretic orbits that are structurally stable.

This is the point at which G-walk chemistry connects to Orbit Computing — the subject of a companion paper.

## What G-walk chemistry cannot do

Honest scope is important. The orbit occupancy vector captures properties that depend only on *which orbit electrons occupy*, not on the fine structure within an orbit. Bond lengths, vibrational frequencies, reaction energies, solvation effects, and non-adiabatic dynamics all require the electronic wavefunction in detail, and for these DFT and wavefunction methods remain necessary.

The stopping criterion is explicit: if ORBIT(G, ρ) returns a unique orbit label, G-walk chemistry is sufficient. If it returns a degenerate label — multiple microstates within one orbit — you need a wavefunction method to resolve the degeneracy. This is not a limitation unique to G-walk chemistry; it is the boundary between group theory and analysis, made precise.

## The big picture

The Woodward-Hoffmann rules (Nobel Prize 1981) showed that orbital symmetry governs which organic reactions are thermally allowed — without computing any wavefunctions. G-walk chemistry generalises this: for inorganic and biological transition-metal systems, site-symmetry orbits govern spin state, lability, and catalytic cycle stoichiometry. The symmetry group of the molecule is doing the computation.

The implication for catalyst design is direct. The current DFT-based design loop (propose a molecule → run DFT for weeks → check spin state → iterate) can be replaced for orbit-determined properties by a lookup: choose G from the target reaction's symmetry requirements → read the orbit walk → select ligands from the spectrochemical series. No computation in the usual sense is required.
