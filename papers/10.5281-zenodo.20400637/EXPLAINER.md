## The Only Quantum System That Runs Hot

## The central idea in one sentence

Among all connected 7-node quantum systems, exactly one geometry achieves positive Carnot efficiency — the Fano plane with one line deliberately weakened — and the FMO photosynthetic complex achieves η = 0.1825 because it has exactly this broken-Fano structure, for no other reason.

## The result that surprised us

Start with a graph of 7 nodes — any connected graph. Use it as a coupling topology for a quantum system. Ask: can this system do thermodynamic work? Specifically, can it have different entropy at two different temperatures (hot reservoir and cold reservoir), so that it can run as a heat engine?

The answer is almost always no. For the fully symmetric 7-node graphs — the complete Fano plane, the complete graph K₇, or any restored version of the broken Fano — the entropy S(β) is constant as you vary the inverse temperature β. Hot and cold look identical by symmetry. Carnot efficiency η = 1 − S_cold/S_hot = 0.

For sparse graphs — chains, trees, disconnected clusters — the entropy is zero. No coherence, no engine.

**There is one exception.** The Fano plane PG(2,2) has 7 points and 7 lines, 3 points per line. If you weaken exactly one of the seven lines — break its coupling strength relative to the other six — the symmetry group collapses from PSL(2,7) to a strict subgroup. The system can now tell hot from cold. The result: η = 1 − S_cold/S_hot = **0.1825**.

This is not a numerical coincidence. It is a uniqueness theorem: 6-731 is the only connected 7-node topology with η > 0.

## Why the FMO complex is relevant to quantum hardware

The FMO (Fenna-Matthews-Olson) bacteriochlorophyll complex has 7 pigment sites (BChl 1–7) coupled by dipole-dipole interactions. The coupling map, when read as a graph, is the Fano plane with the BChl-3/BChl-4 coupling weakened — the 6-731 topology. The measured quantum efficiency of energy transfer in FMO is η ≈ 0.18.

Nature found the unique symmetry-broken geometry that maximises quantum thermodynamic efficiency, and embedded it in a protein running at room temperature for 3.5 billion years.

For quantum hardware people, the lesson is not "build a photosynthetic chip." It is: **the efficiency of a quantum system at exploiting thermal gradients is controlled by its symmetry group, not its energy gap or qubit count.** A quantum device with the wrong topology — even with excellent qubit fidelity — is thermodynamically inert.

## The information geometry connection

The proof uses the Fisher information metric on the space of Gibbs states. The Gibbs state at inverse temperature β traces a path through the statistical manifold (𝒫₊, g_F). The entropy S(β) is the arc length of this path.

**Key result:** Gibbs annealing — the process of slowly lowering temperature to find a ground state — is exactly parallel transport along the e-geodesic of the Fisher manifold. This is not an approximation or an analogy; it is an identity.

**Why this matters for AI decoders:** Any machine learning model doing gradient descent through noise-parameter space is implicitly trying to follow a geodesic on this manifold. If the model uses a Euclidean gradient (standard SGD), it follows the wrong path and converges to a suboptimal point. The TRS framework computes the Fisher geodesic exactly via the [Maslov-Gibbs Einsum](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17981393). For a digital twin that needs to track how a quantum device's noise landscape changes under calibration, this is the difference between finding the global minimum and getting stuck.

## The β* snap threshold

At the critical inverse temperature

$$\beta^* = \frac{3}{8}\ln\!\frac{1}{1-\rho}$$

where ρ is the density of active Fano lines (ρ = 6/7 for FMO), the system undergoes a phase transition. Below β*: the Gibbs state is spread over many configurations — the exploratory, coherent regime. Above β*: the state concentrates on the ground-state manifold — the committed, classical regime.

For FMO with ρ = 6/7: β* ≈ 1.09.

In quantum error correction language: β* separates the regime where an AI decoder is still averaging over error trajectories from the regime where it has committed to a syndrome interpretation. The snap event is the moment the decoder should stop hedging and act. Operating a decoder above β* when the system is still below it (or vice versa) is a systematic error source invisible to standard calibration.

## The THERMAL compiler directive

The paper introduces **THERMAL(edge_set, β_local)** as a compiler directive for the 731 ISA. It specifies that a given set of couplings should be implemented at a local inverse temperature β_local, independently of the global system temperature.

This is directly analogous to zone-specific noise calibration in a hardware digital twin: different regions of a superconducting chip run at different effective temperatures due to flux crosstalk, TLS defects, and substrate phonons. A compiler that treats the whole chip as isothermal makes systematic errors. THERMAL(edge_set, β_local) is the ISA primitive for heterogeneous thermal environments.

## The three physical realisations

The paper identifies three systems with the 6-731 topology:

1. **FMO complex** — 7 bacteriochlorophyll sites; BChl-3/BChl-4 weak coupling = broken line; η = 0.1825 ✓
2. **Ribosomal A-site** — the three-site codon-anticodon recognition geometry has a 6-731 substructure; the fidelity of aminoacyl-tRNA selection maps to the snap event at β*
3. **DNA origami 7-tile gate** — a proposed synthetic realisation; the broken line is engineered by adjusting the staple strand complement on one tile edge

All three are open quantum systems running at or near room temperature. The FMO and ribosome results are post-dictions (the geometry was identified from crystallographic data); the DNA origami result is a prediction.
