# The Architecture of Inevitability: An Accessible Guide

*Plain-language explainer for [doi:10.5281/zenodo.19928880](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19928880) (#263)*

## Why do we care?

Every major computer architecture — from von Neumann machines to GPUs to quantum computers — was designed by humans making choices: how many registers, how wide the data bus, what the instruction set should look like. These choices are arbitrary, driven by engineering trade-offs and historical accident. A different design team in a parallel universe might have made completely different choices and built equally capable machines.

This paper asks: **is there an architecture that could not have been designed differently?** One whose structure is forced by mathematics itself — where the instruction set, the register file, and the memory topology are all consequences of a single geometric axiom? The answer proposed is yes: the $G_2$ Frog architecture, whose design is "inevitable" in the sense that any deviation from it produces a system that is physically inconsistent.

## The controversial claim

The central assertion is that **the Four-Leg Constraint is not an engineering choice but a physical law.** Standard computer architecture research treats the number of operands per instruction as a tunable parameter. This paper claims that when computation is embedded in $G_2$ geometry, the number of operands is fixed at exactly 4 by the Fano incidence rules — just as the number of dimensions of space-time is fixed by the laws of physics. A 5-operand instruction is not merely inefficient; it is geometrically self-contradictory.

## Reasons not to be sceptical

- **The Fano plane has exactly 7 points and 7 lines.** Each line contains exactly 3 points. A "Frog" (tetrahedron) has exactly 4 faces. These are combinatorial facts, not design choices — and they lock together to give exactly 4 as the unique consistent operand count.
- **The Associator Penalty is an exact bound.** The Fano-Fisher metric proves that any non-Fano triple incurs a cost of exactly $8/3$ — not approximately $8/3$, but exactly. This gives the architecture a built-in error detector: any instruction that violates the Four-Leg Constraint produces a measurable geometric signature.
- **The Polarity Rule prevents ambiguity.** The rule that opposite poles of a face-weld must carry different Fano colours is a discrete symmetry condition that eliminates all gauge freedom from the instruction encoding. There is exactly one valid way to label each instruction, making the architecture self-describing.

## The technical core

The paper derives the full instruction set of the Frog architecture from first principles, starting from the single axiom that computation is a **Monadic Descent** on the $G_2$ manifold. The **Tree-Frog** (tetrahedron) is the fundamental computational unit; its four **Ribbon-Legs** (triangular faces) are the four operand slots. The **Colour Scheme** (assignment of Fano colours to vertices) determines the type of each operand. The **Mirror Square** rewrite rule ($\diamond \circ \blacksquare = \triangleright \circ \blacktriangle = \mathrm{id}$) is the only algebraic identity needed to derive all five compiler rewrite rules.

## Risks and open problems

The primary risk is **physical realisation**. The architecture is mathematically inevitable given $G_2$ geometry, but $G_2$ geometry must itself be physically instantiated. If the substrate only approximately satisfies $G_2$ symmetry (as any real material will), the "inevitability" becomes an approximation. A secondary risk is **scalability**: the Frog architecture has been validated at the level of individual instructions and small programs, but it is not yet known whether the Four-Leg Constraint scales gracefully to programs with millions of instructions.
