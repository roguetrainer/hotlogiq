## The central idea in one sentence

Orbit computing — a model in which the state is a group-orbit occupancy vector, transitions are orbit walks implemented by seven ISA opcodes, and the output is a discrete orbit label — is a fourth paradigm of computation, distinguished from classical, quantum-gate, and quantum-annealing computing by operating at room temperature without quantum error correction.

## Three paradigms and their limits

The history of computing distinguishes three paradigms:

**Classical computing** (1940s–present): the state is a string of bits, transitions are Boolean gates, computation runs at room temperature. Universal, programmable, cheap — but cannot efficiently simulate quantum systems.

**Quantum-gate computing** (1990s–present): the state is a coherent superposition of $2^n$ qubit amplitudes, transitions are unitary gates, and the system must be cooled to roughly 15 millikelvin to prevent decoherence from destroying the superposition. Exponentially powerful for certain problems, but the engineering challenge of maintaining coherence at scale has consumed 30 years of effort.

**Quantum annealing** (2000s–present): the state is a classical Ising configuration $\{\pm 1\}^n$, transitions happen via quantum tunnelling through an externally programmed energy landscape, and the system must also be kept near absolute zero. Good for certain optimisation problems, but the problem structure must be re-encoded externally for each new instance.

All three paradigms share one bottleneck: any quantum-mechanical advantage requires either millikelvin temperatures or accepting classical limitations.

Orbit computing breaks this constraint — not by avoiding quantum mechanics, but by exploiting a different layer of it.

## What is an orbit computer?

An orbit computer has three components:

**State.** The stored state is a G-orbit occupancy vector $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, \ldots, v_k) \in \mathbb{Z}^k$, where $G$ is a symmetry group acting on the physical state space of the substrate (a molecule), and $v_i$ counts the occupied slots in the $i$-th orbit of the valence shell. This is a discrete, classical label — not a quantum superposition.

**Transitions.** State transitions are implemented by seven opcodes that act on the orbit vector: FLIP (add an electron to orbit $i$), FLOP (remove one), TWIST (exchange electrons between orbits $i$ and $j$), SPLIT (divide one orbit into two under symmetry breaking), SPLAT (merge orbits under symmetry restoration), ORBIT (measure the current orbit label), and LABEL (initialise).

**Output.** The output of a computation is the sequence of orbit labels returned by ORBIT measurements — for example, the chemical identity of the products of a catalytic reaction.

The physical substrate is any molecule whose state space admits a group action $G$. Computation proceeds by executing opcodes, which correspond to physical operations: adding an electron (FLIP), changing spin state (TWIST), or binding a substrate molecule (SPLAT).

## Why the computation is decoherence-immune

The central theoretical claim is the **Structural Decoherence Immunity theorem**: the G-orbit label of a molecular system is stable against environmental decoherence at room temperature.

The argument is straightforward. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the nuclear framework of a molecule is fixed on electronic timescales. Nuclear positions relax on timescales of roughly $10^{-13}$ seconds (a single vibration). Electronic decoherence — the scrambling of electronic quantum coherence by thermal noise — occurs on timescales of roughly $10^{-12}$ seconds. But the orbit label is determined by the nuclear geometry, not by the electronic wavefunction. Electronic decoherence scrambles the electronic state *within* an orbit; it does not change *which orbit* the electron occupies, because that is set by the nuclear framework.

The analogy is a magnetic hard drive. Individual electron spins fluctuate thermally, but the macroscopic magnetic domain (the bit value) is stable because it is a collective degree of freedom. The orbit label is stable for the same reason: it is a group-theoretic invariant of the nuclear structure, not an individual electronic state.

This is what makes enzyme active sites possible. Nitrogenase fixes nitrogen at 300 K, running a 14-opcode programme (described below) with zero engineered error correction, because the Fano orbit structure of the FeMo-cofactor is enforced by the protein scaffold — a physical structure stable at biological temperatures.

## The four paradigms side by side

| Paradigm | State | Transitions | Temperature | Programmability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Classical | Bit string | Boolean gates | 300 K | High |
| Quantum-gate | Qubit superposition | Unitary gates | ~15 mK | High |
| Quantum-annealing | Ising configuration | Quantum tunnelling | ~15 mK | High |
| **Orbit** | G-orbit occupancy vector | ISA opcode walk | **300 K** | Fixed by synthesis |

The crucial distinction from quantum annealing is where the problem structure lives. In D-Wave annealing, the problem is encoded externally in coupling constants $J_{ij}$ that must be programmed for each new instance. In Orbit computing, the problem structure is intrinsic to the molecule: synthesising the molecule *is* programming the computer. Once synthesised, the G-orbit walk is fixed.

The crucial distinction from gate-model quantum computing is that stored orbit labels are classical and stable; quantum mechanics lives only in the *transitions* (executing an opcode requires satisfying quantum-mechanical selection rules), not in the *storage*.

## Hello World at four levels

**Level 0 — Spin-state query** (demonstrated). Hardware: any Fe(II) complex plus a magnetometer. Programme: `ORBIT(O_h, ρ_{d^6})` — one measurement. Output: high-spin or low-spin. This is already more accurate than most DFT functionals and takes zero computation (see the companion paper on G-walk chemistry).

**Level 1 — Deutsch's algorithm on an Fe dimer**. Hardware: two exchange-coupled Fe(II) centres sharing a bridging ligand. Programme: initialise both centres with site groups $G_1$, $G_2$; measure `ORBIT(G_\text{dimer}, ρ)`. Output: $S_\text{total} = 0$ (antiferromagnetic coupling, the two ligand fields are *different*) or $S_\text{total} = 2$ (ferromagnetic, they are the *same*). One measurement determines a global property of a two-variable function — exactly Deutsch's algorithm.

**Level 2 — Grover search on a Fano register** (proposed). Hardware: the FeMo-cofactor or a synthetic Fe$_7$ Fano cluster. Three TWIST operations implement a Grover diffusion operator on 7 Fano points. Output: identity of the marked site. Measurement by site-selective ${}^{57}$Fe Mössbauer or ENDOR spectroscopy. Required temperature: liquid nitrogen (77 K), no dilution refrigerator.

**Level 3 — Nitrogen fixation** (demonstrated conceptually). Hardware: nitrogenase (already exists in nature). Programme: 14 opcodes on the 7-orbit Fano register. Output: NH₃ (measurable by standard assays). Temperature: 300 K. The 14-opcode count is not an approximation — it matches the Thorneley-Lowe kinetic scheme that has described biological nitrogen fixation for 40 years.

## Honest scope: what Orbit computing cannot do

Orbit computing is not universal. The computation is restricted to G-orbit walks for the specific group $G$ of the physical substrate. To change the computation you must change the molecule. For problems whose structure does not match any molecular G-orbit graph — arbitrary Boolean satisfiability, arbitrary integer arithmetic, arbitrary graph problems — Orbit computing is not applicable.

It also cannot compute fine structure *within* an orbit. Bond lengths, reaction energies, vibrational spectra, and non-adiabatic dynamics all require the electronic wavefunction in detail. DFT and wavefunction methods remain essential for these. The boundary is precise: if the property in question depends only on *which orbit* electrons occupy (not on their wavefunction within the orbit), Orbit computing is sufficient. If not, conventional methods are needed.

## The big picture

Biology discovered Orbit computing 3.8 billion years ago. Every enzyme is a fixed-function Orbit computer: its G-orbit walk is hardwired by evolution (the amino acid sequence determines the protein fold, which sets the metal cluster geometry, which fixes the symmetry group G). Nitrogenase, cytochrome P450, photosystem II, and the ribosome are all Orbit computers running specific ISA programmes at room temperature with zero engineered error correction.

The papers establishing the orbit framework ([doi:10.5281/zenodo.21219722](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21219722), [doi:10.5281/zenodo.21224107](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21224107)) identify the mathematical structure of what enzymes compute; this paper names the paradigm and provides the design rules for building new Orbit computers. The ISA is the instruction set. The spectrochemical series is the gate-parameter lookup. The synthetic chemist is the chip fabricator.
