# Start Here
{: .no_toc }

The ASA project spans quantum computing, financial risk, spectroscopy, climate economics, and pure mathematics — all unified by the same five-opcode instruction set. This page maps the shortest path to the core ideas for each reader type.

## For everyone first

These two papers require no specialist background. Start with one of them regardless of your field.

**[In Praise of Tetrahedra](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20581484)** (Paper 386)
The simplest possible non-trivial simplex — four objects, six edges, four faces — encodes the Ponzano–Regge amplitude, the 6j symbol, the Wigner tetrahedron, and the fundamental unit of the Origami ISA. This is the geometric seed from which everything else grows.

**[An Adelic Invitation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19977475)** (Paper 219)
The founding thesis: why the division algebra ladder **ℝ → ℂ → ℍ → 𝕆** is the right organisational principle for a unified theory of physics, computation, and economics. Accessible to anyone comfortable with complex numbers.

## For quantum computing researchers

*Prerequisite: stabiliser states, the Clifford group, T-gates.*

1. **[Projective Geometry as the Mother Tongue of Quantum Mechanics](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20634729)** (Paper 393)
   The 3-qubit Pauli group is secretly the Fano plane. Brody & Hughston's CP^n formalism meets the Fano orbit decomposition of magic states.

2. **[The Fano Plane is the Right Way to Think About Qubits](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20667176)** (Paper 408)
   The practitioner primer. Stabiliser states → Origami ISA → three levels of quantum resource (stabiliser / standard magic / associamancy). No octonion knowledge required.

3. **[The Origami ISA as Nature's Universal Computer](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20543454)** (Paper 370)
   One instruction set across twenty orders of magnitude: nuclear spectroscopy, GPU matrix multiplication, quantum error correction, and financial XVA are all the same five-opcode programme.

**Then, for the deeper results:**

- [Fano Geometry as a Unifying Language for QEC](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20541595) (Paper 363) — GHZ generates Steane; orbit decomposition of magic; Fano self-test with C = 7/8
- [Non-Associative Hardware is Necessary for the Non-Abelian StateHSP](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20667170) (Paper 405) — PSL(2,7) solved; why associative hardware provably fails
- [Associamancy: A Resource Theory of Non-Associative Quantum Magic](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20667174) (Paper 407) — the Schur boundary; ν₂ = 0; Freudenthal ladder

## For economists and financial practitioners

*Prerequisite: familiarity with credit exposure, derivatives, or macroeconomic models.*

1. **[EconIAC: A Differentiable Economics Engine — Overview and Reading Guide](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20679006)** (Paper 409)
   What EconIAC is, why the mathematics matters, and where to start. Maps all 19 published economics papers with hyperlinked DOIs. Read this first.

2. **[The Topology of Risk: A Primer on Cohomology for Financial Practitioners](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20642983)** (Paper 398)
   Teaches H⁰/H¹/H² from scratch using the 2008 crisis as the running example. No mathematical prerequisites beyond knowing what a credit exposure is.

3. **[A Primer on Economic Gauge Theory](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20259505)** (Paper 301)
   Why double-entry accounting is a gauge theory; why arbitrage is curvature; why the Pacioli identity is a conservation law. For economists and policy audiences.

**Then, for specific applications:**

- [Systemic Risk as H²](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20642908) (Paper 397) — the 2008 crisis as a topological event; stress-testing framework
- [Tipping Points Are Topological](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20653285) (Paper 403) — climate tipping cascades; H¹-corrected social cost of carbon
- [The Origami ISA as Financial Middleware](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20645695) (Paper 399) — SPLIT and SPLAT as Čech coboundary; model-free XVA

## For biologists and biochemists

*Prerequisite: familiarity with molecular biology, structural biochemistry, or biophysics. No quantum mechanics or representation theory required.*

The core claim: every molecular machine that processes angular momentum — a ribosome decoding a codon, the FMO photosynthetic complex funnelling energy, nitrogenase breaking the N≡N triple bond — is running an Origami ISA programme. The same five opcodes that describe quantum circuits describe these biological systems, at the same level of mathematical precision.

1. **[Molecular Machines as Origami ISA Programmes](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20682101)** (Paper 413)
   The biology entry point. Covers all three molecular machines — ribosome, FMO, nitrogenase — in one paper written for biologists with no quantum computing background. Includes the parameter-free prediction η = 0.1825 for FMO efficiency, the structural evidence for 6/7 Fano topology at the ribosomal A-site, and the G₂ triality mechanism for nitrogen fixation. Start here.

**Then, for each machine in depth:**

2. **[The Decoding Engine](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20400652)** (Paper 324)
   Full treatment of the ribosome as an Origami ISA programme. The 6j symbol is the codon–anticodon recognition step; 6/7 Fano-line coverage in the cognate state (PDB: 4V9D); connection to kinetic proofreading.

3. **[The Topological Heat Engine](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20400638)** (Paper 325)
   Full proof that the broken-Fano topology is the unique 7-node graph with positive Carnot efficiency. FMO efficiency η = 0.1825 derived from crystal structure alone. Testable predictions for Tyr16 mutation and DNA origami implementation.

4. **[Virtual Monopoles in the FeMo-Cofactor](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20346650)** (Paper 318)
   Nitrogenase and the [7Fe-9S-Mo] cluster as a 731 ISA register. G₂ triality and virtual monopoles. Predictions for time-resolved EXAFS and Mössbauer spectroscopy.

**Then, for spectroscopists:**

- [Spiders for Spectra](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20458996) (Paper 347) — atomic spectra as Origami ISA circuits; diagrammatic angular-momentum calculus for any atom
- [Spiders for Nuclei](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20490046) (Paper 348) — nuclear spectroscopy; the Pandya transform is the FLIP opcode; ISA programs for shell-model transitions
- [Spectroscopic Circuits Are Small](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20584560) (Paper 374) — 3–21 qubits suffice to simulate all known nuclear and atomic spectra; ISA circuit sizes for H through Cf

## For mathematicians

*Prerequisite: comfortable with representation theory or category theory.*

1. **[The Origami Calculus](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20474914)** (Paper 349)
   A diagrammatic framework for the representation theory of compact groups, grounded in the Ponzano–Regge tetrahedron. The mathematical foundation for all ISA opcodes.

2. **[In Praise of Qudits](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20269991)** (Paper 310)
   Why d > 2 quantum systems are natural: the TriQ (d=3) and SevenQ (d=7) registers as the minimal hardware for qudit stabiliser learning and PSL(2,7) Fourier sampling.

3. **[The 6j Symbol as H¹](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20635479)** (Paper 396)
   The 6j symbol is the H¹ obstruction of the representation sheaf over an interaction diagram. Connects angular momentum recoupling, XVA, and sheaf cohomology.

**Then, for the frontier:**

- [Associamancy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20667174) (Paper 407) — Frobenius-Schur indicators; q ≡ 3 (mod 4) criterion; Freudenthal magic square
- [Non-Abelian StateHSP](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20667170) (Paper 405) — proof that i√7/2 requires non-associative hardware; Gauss sum identity
- [The 731-Calculus Part 1](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19713350) (Paper 207) — the magmoidal category; frog vertex (BIND opcode); non-associative string diagrams; the diagrammatic language underlying associamancy
- [The 731 Frog Calculus Part 2](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20139448) (Paper 281) — G₂ spin foams; octonion diagram rewriting rules; the non-associative Pachner moves
