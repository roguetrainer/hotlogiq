## For everyone first

These papers require no specialist background. Start with one of them regardless of your field.

**[Planck's Constant in Disguise](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20752384)** (Paper 443)
Six famous equations from six different fields — Schrödinger, Black-Scholes, Sinkhorn optimal transport, Viterbi, Cole-Hopf, and quantum groups — are all the same equation, controlled by the same algebraic parameter. The ML engineer's softmax temperature, the physicist's Planck's constant, and the quant's volatility are all the same object. No prior knowledge of the TRS framework required; every reader will find their own field in the table.

**[In Praise of Tetrahedra](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20581484)** (Paper 386)
The simplest possible non-trivial simplex — four objects, six edges, four faces — encodes the Ponzano–Regge amplitude, the 6j symbol, the Wigner tetrahedron, and the fundamental unit of the Origami ISA. This is the geometric seed from which everything else grows.

**[An Adelic Invitation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19977475)** (Paper 219)
The founding thesis: why the division algebra ladder **ℝ → ℂ → ℍ → 𝕆** is the right organisational principle for a unified theory of physics, computation, and economics. Accessible to anyone comfortable with complex numbers.

## For quantum computing researchers

*Prerequisite: stabiliser states, the Clifford group, T-gates.*

1. **[The Meld ISA: Complex-MGE, Quantum Algorithm Discovery, and the T-Gate as Octonion Obstruction](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20773563)** (Paper 454)
   The quantum branch of the ISA trilogy. Shor's algorithm as a three-layer Origami/Meld/Origami programme; QFT as a SPLIT-TWIST cascade; T-gate = BIND = Fano associator obstruction; why LWE noise kills the Fourier peak and makes ML-KEM quantum-resistant. The fastest entry point for anyone working on quantum algorithms or hardware simulation.

2. **[Eight Derivations of a Universal Instruction Set](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20774076)** (Paper 455)
   Eight independent routes — Pachner moves, Wigner-Racah spectroscopy, Mac Lane Pentagon, compact closed categories, Frobenius algebras, Fisher information geometry, Hodge decomposition, quantum gate sets — all landing on the same five opcodes. Explains *why* this gate set is universal at a deeper level than Solovay-Kitaev.

3. **[The H^k Complexity Ladder](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20773526)** (Paper 420)
   H⁰ = classical (PSPACE), H¹ = statistical (BPP), H² = quantum (BQP). A graded, computable alternative to the P=NP question. The β* snap threshold identifies where on the complexity dial any given algorithm sits.

**Then, for the ISA foundations:**

- [The Origami ISA](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19916429) (Paper 258) — the classical β→∞ ISA; FLIP/FLOP/SPLIT/SPLAT/TWIST/SWAP/LABEL; Wigner 6j symbol as H¹
- [The Forge ISA](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20694527) (Paper 419) — the statistical 0<β<∞ ISA; snap event at β*; vorton architecture; thermodynamic computation
- [Projective Geometry as the Mother Tongue of QM](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20634729) (Paper 393) — the 3-qubit Pauli group is the Fano plane; Fano orbit decomposition of magic states

**For quantum error correction specifically:**

- [Fano Geometry as a Unifying Language for QEC](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20541595) (Paper 363) — GHZ generates Steane; orbit decomposition of magic; Fano self-test with C = 7/8
- [Non-Associative Hardware is Necessary for the Non-Abelian HSP](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20667170) (Paper 405) — PSL(2,7) solved; why associative hardware provably fails
- [Associamancy: A Resource Theory of Non-Associative Quantum Magic](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20667174) (Paper 407) — the Schur boundary; ν₂ = 0; Freudenthal ladder

## For economists and financial practitioners

*Prerequisite: familiarity with credit exposure, derivatives, or macroeconomic models.*

1. **[EconIAC: A Differentiable Economics Engine — Overview and Reading Guide](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20679006)** (Paper 409)
   What EconIAC is, why the mathematics matters, and where to start. Maps all 19 published economics papers with hyperlinked DOIs. Read this first.

2. **[The Topology of Risk: A Primer on Cohomology for Financial Practitioners](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20642983)** (Paper 398)
   Teaches H⁰/H¹/H² from scratch using the 2008 crisis as the running example. No mathematical prerequisites beyond knowing what a credit exposure is.

3. **[A Primer on Economic Gauge Theory](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20259505)** (Paper 301)
   Why double-entry accounting is a gauge theory; why arbitrage is curvature; why the Pacioli identity is a conservation law. For economists and policy audiences.

**Then, for specific applications:**

- [Systemic Risk as H²](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20642908) (Paper 397) — the 2008 crisis as a topological event; stress-testing framework
- [Tipping Points Are Topological](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20653285) (Paper 403) — climate tipping cascades; H¹-corrected social cost of carbon

## For biologists and biochemists

*Prerequisite: familiarity with molecular biology, structural biochemistry, or biophysics. No quantum mechanics or representation theory required.*

The core claim: every molecular machine that processes angular momentum — a ribosome decoding a codon, the FMO photosynthetic complex funnelling energy, nitrogenase breaking the N≡N triple bond — is running an Origami ISA programme. The same five opcodes that describe quantum circuits describe these biological systems, at the same level of mathematical precision.

1. **[Molecular Machines as Origami ISA Programmes](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20682101)** (Paper 413)
   The biology entry point. Covers all three molecular machines — ribosome, FMO, nitrogenase — in one paper written for biologists with no quantum computing background. Includes the parameter-free prediction η = 0.1825 for FMO efficiency, the structural evidence for 6/7 Fano topology at the ribosomal A-site, and the G₂ triality mechanism for nitrogen fixation. Start here.

**Then, for each machine in depth:**

2. **[The Decoding Engine](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20400652)** (Paper 324)
   Full treatment of the ribosome as an Origami ISA programme. The 6j symbol is the codon–anticodon recognition step; 6/7 Fano-line coverage in the cognate state (PDB: 4V9D); connection to kinetic proofreading.

3. **[The Topological Heat Engine](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20400638)** (Paper 325)
   Full proof that the broken-Fano topology is the unique 7-node graph with positive Carnot efficiency. FMO efficiency η = 0.1825 derived from crystal structure alone. Testable predictions for Tyr16 mutation and DNA origami implementation.

4. **[Virtual Monopoles in the FeMo-Cofactor](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20346650)** (Paper 318)
   Nitrogenase and the [7Fe-9S-Mo] cluster as a 731 ISA register. G₂ triality and virtual monopoles. Predictions for time-resolved EXAFS and Mössbauer spectroscopy.

**Then, for spectroscopists:**

- [Spiders for Spectra](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20458996) (Paper 347) — atomic spectra as Origami ISA circuits; diagrammatic angular-momentum calculus for any atom
- [Spiders for Nuclei](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20490046) (Paper 348) — nuclear spectroscopy; the Pandya transform is the FLIP opcode; ISA programs for shell-model transitions
- [Spectroscopic Circuits Are Small](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20584560) (Paper 374) — 3–21 qubits suffice to simulate all known nuclear and atomic spectra; ISA circuit sizes for H through Cf

## For mathematicians

*Prerequisite: comfortable with representation theory or category theory.*

1. **[Eight Derivations of a Universal Instruction Set](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20774076)** (Paper 455)
   Eight independent routes — Pachner moves, Wigner-Racah, Mac Lane Pentagon, compact closed categories, Frobenius algebras, Fisher information geometry, Hodge decomposition, quantum gate sets — all forced to the same five generators. Shum's theorem (1994) explains why: the free ribbon pivotal category on one self-dual object has exactly five generators, forced by the topology of framed tangles. Closes an 80-year fragmentation between spectroscopy (Racah 1942), categorical QM (Abramsky-Coecke 2004), and quantum computing (Boykin 1999).

2. **[The Origami Calculus](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20474914)** (Paper 349)
   A diagrammatic framework for the representation theory of compact groups, grounded in the Ponzano–Regge tetrahedron. The mathematical foundation for all ISA opcodes.

3. **[In Praise of Qudits](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20269991)** (Paper 310)
   Why d > 2 quantum systems are natural: the TriQ (d=3) and SevenQ (d=7) registers as the minimal hardware for qudit stabiliser learning and PSL(2,7) Fourier sampling.

3. **[The Unhedgeability Theorem](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20635479)** (Paper 396)
   A financial risk is hedgeable with bilateral instruments iff its class is trivial in H¹ of the pricing sheaf over an interaction diagram. Convexity, basis risk, and XVA are all H¹ classes — proved directly from the Čech complex, no representation theory required.

**Then, for the frontier:**

- [Associamancy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20667174) (Paper 407) — Frobenius-Schur indicators; q ≡ 3 (mod 4) criterion; Freudenthal magic square
- [Non-Abelian StateHSP](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20667170) (Paper 405) — proof that i√7/2 requires non-associative hardware; Gauss sum identity
- [The 731-Calculus Part 1](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19713350) (Paper 207) — the magmoidal category; frog vertex (BIND opcode); non-associative string diagrams; the diagrammatic language underlying associamancy
- [The 731 Frog Calculus Part 2](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20139448) (Paper 281) — G₂ spin foams; octonion diagram rewriting rules; the non-associative Pachner moves

**If you know complex analysis:** the Cauchy-Riemann conditions are the oldest instance of the H¹=0 pattern in the ASA programme.
The condition $\bar\partial f = 0$ is the Pentagon identity SPLAT∘SPLIT = 0 for the $\bar\partial$ operator.
The three-level ladder — $H^1(\mathbb{C},\mathcal{O})=0$ (Mittag-Leffler), $H^1(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\},\mathcal{O})=\mathbb{R}$ (residue theorem), $H^1(\text{genus-}g,\mathcal{O})=\mathbb{C}^g$ (Riemann-Roch) — is the clearest illustration of how $\dim H^1$ counts the number of FLOP corrections needed.
See the remark in §3.6 of [H¹=0 is the Performance Condition](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20684509) (Paper 415) for the full treatment, and [Hodge Theory is the Smooth Limit](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20684838) (Paper 417) for the connection to the $\bar\partial$-Neumann problem and Dolbeault cohomology.
